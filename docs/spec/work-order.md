# Work Order

**Purpose:** track production from creation through routing processes to QC. Aggregates timesheet and process parameters scanned at the Production Terminal.
**Feeds:** Production Terminal, Process Parameter Confirmation, QC Approval, NCR, PO-Subcon (routing process tagging), Delivery Order, COC, all reports.

A Work Order No is **auto-generated** when its parent SO is confirmed, but the WO record must be **created** in this module before operations begin.

## Structure (4 levels)

```
Work Order
└── In Process Description (component / sub-assembly / final assy)
    └── Routing Process (a row from Process Profile + target date)
        ├── Employee (auto from terminal scan IN/OUT)
        └── Process Parameter  (Welding | Spray Painting | Machining)
```

## Number format

`8XXXXX-A-B` (`A` = part index in SO, `B` = batch index of that part) → `800003-2-5`.

## Status flow

```
Draft     — on WO creation
Proceed   — planner has set routing process and clicked [Proceed]; production may scan in
WIP       — at least one routing process started
On Hold   — paused; workers may scan OUT, cannot scan IN
Pending for QC — all routing processes complete; awaiting QC
Completed — QC approved; delivery allowed
Void      — allowed only while Draft
Cancelled — cancel a Proceed or WIP WO
```

## Creation flow

1. Click `[Outstanding Work]` → popup shows SO batches without a WO yet.
2. Select a batch → `[Create New Work Order]` → WO created with status Draft.

## Top-level rules

- **Quantity is fixed** — you cannot change WO quantity or split a WO. Different splits require different SO batches.
- Materials / quantities used per in-process-assembly are **not** captured.
- WO tracks only the main product as described by Job Description; no assembly parts or inventory.
- **No in-system rework.** If quantity is rejected mid-run, raise NCR (offline rework). The WO can still proceed to the next routing process with the original quantity as a whole; next process does **not** wait for NCR to be submitted.
- Customer return = a **new** sales order, not a modification of the existing WO.
- **Optional routing**: if the WO has no in-house routing (subcon-only), planner can flag that. WO goes to WIP when subcon PO is issued and to Completed when subcon items are fully received.
- NCR can be raised any time before the WO is Completed.
- Delivery requires WO Completed (QC approved).

## Routing process rules

- **One WO = one set of routing process planning.**
- Planner plans routing processes for main assembly, in-process-assemblies, in-process-components.
- Only **Target Completion Date** is required per process (no start date).
- Target Completion Dates appear in the Monthly Schedule report (auto-refresh every 5 min).
- **QC is always the last routing process.** No in-process QC. QC time is **not** counted as routing cost.
- Purchaser can issue a PO-Subcon **only after** routing is set.
- A routing process tagged with subcon cannot start until that subcon PO is **fully received**.
- Within one in-process-assembly: routing runs **strictly in sequence**, no parallel.
- Across different in-process-assemblies: routing can run **concurrently** provided the planner sets `Conditional SN` preconditions correctly.
- A new in-process or routing process added later can only be **appended after** existing completed and WIP ones.
- User can advance to the next routing process only when **all WO quantity** for the current routing process is completed.

## Timesheet

- Populated by Production Terminal scan IN/OUT.
- Total minute & process cost is computed (Cost Per Minute × minutes).
- Authorized user may overwrite timesheet info.

## Process parameters

- Three forms — **Welding / Spray Painting / Machining** — chosen by the flag set on the Process Profile row.
- All parameter values flow in from Production Terminal scan-out; only Supervisor can confirm them (Process Parameter Confirmation module).

## Label printing

The Label Expiry Date / Qty / UOM fields exist on the WO header for the Delivery Label printout only — **they do not save into the system** (Qty/UOM default from WO; user may override before printing).
