# Subcon Purchasing

Subcon (sub-contractor / outsource) chain — **separate from material purchasing**. No PR.

Chain: **PO-Subcon → PO-Subcon Approval → Subcon Request Form (SRF) → Subcon Return Tracking (SRT)**.

---

## PO — Subcon

**Purpose:** order outsourced services. May tie to a work order's specific routing process, or be free of any WO.

### Rules

- Two flavours: with-WO, without-WO. (Vision Laser is without-WO only; gated by `Allow to create PO for WO` on Company Profile.)
- **1 PO : 1 WO : n Part Descriptions : n Routing Processes.**
- One WO can issue multiple PO-Subcons.
- If one Part requires multiple processes, the purchaser **splits the lines** so each line maps to exactly one routing process.
- **No PR required** (unlike material POs).
- Same value-banded **two-tier approval** as material POs (see Approval Level Profile). On approve, **no auto-email to supplier** — purchaser sends manually.
- One PO-Subcon printout style; no signature.
- Exchange rate = latest from Currency Profile at PO creation; frozen thereafter.
- **No quantity/UOM conversion** on PO-Subcon items.
- PO UOM can differ from WO UOM.
- A routing process can only start once **all** PO-Subcon quantity for that routing process is fully received (via SRT).
- No discount columns — unit price / amount are the final net.
- Bulk-buy cost-allocation guidance is identical to material POs (split into multiple POs to attribute extra qty to a specific WO or to no WO).

### Number format

`POYYXXXXX-RN`. **Shared sequence with material POs.** Yearly reset.

### Status flow

Identical to material PO: `Draft / Void / Old Version / Revised / Pending For Approval / Rejected / Approved / Issued`. Receive Status: `NA / Not Received / Partially Received / Fully Received`.

### Steps to create

1. Select Company, Date, Purchaser, Supplier, Work Order No (if any), Currency.
2. PO No auto-generated.
3. Add PO items by picking **In-Process / Main Process / Routing Process** when WO is set; or just Main Process + Routing Process when no WO.
4. Fill in Description (to supplier), Quantity, UOM, Unit Price, Delivery Date.

### Fields — header

Same shape as material PO header, **without `PR No`**.

## PO — Subcon Approval

Same mechanism as material PO Approval, **but on Approve the system does not auto-email the supplier or attach the PO PDF** — only the purchaser is notified, and they send the PO out manually.

Read-only module; only user input is `Approval Remark`.

---

## Subcon Request Form (SRF)

**Purpose:** delivery note to the subcontractor — acknowledges items handed over. Mandatory once a PO-Subcon is Issued.

### Rules

- **1 SRF : 1 PO line : 1 Routing Process.**
- **1 PO line : n SRF** — items can be handed over in batches.
- Total SRF quantity per PO line ≤ PO line quantity.
- **No approval, no extra cost column, no UOM conversion.**
- Has its own printout.

### Number format

`SRFYYXXXXX` → `SRF1700003`. Yearly reset.

### Status flow

`Draft → Submitted | Void`. Receive Status (auto, against SRT): `N/A / Partially Received / Fully Received`.

### Steps to create

1. `[Outstanding PO item]` → list of unfulfilled PO-Subcon items.
2. Select a row → form is created with header fields imported.
3. SRF No auto-generated. Fill remaining info.

### Fields

Almost entirely imported from the selected PO item — read-only. User inputs:

| # | Field | Type | Mand | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | Outsourced By | Dropdown (Employee) | Y | default = PO Purchaser |
| 14 | Date Required | Date | Y | default = PO Delivery Date |
| 15 | Received By | Dropdown (Employee) | — | default = PO Contact Person |
| 16 | Quantity | Numeric | Y | 0 dec; default = PO Qty |
| 22 | Remark | Multi-text | N | |
| 23 | Status | Read-only | — | Draft / Void / Submitted |
| 24 | Receive Status | Read-only | — | N/A / Partially Received / Fully Received |

Other read-only header fields imported from PO: Company, SRF No (system), Supplier, PO No, PO Date, Currency, Work Order No, In-Process Description, Main Process, Routing Process, Part Description, PO UOM, Unit Price, Amount, Hardness, Thickness.

## Subcon Return Tracking (SRT)

**Purpose:** receive items back from subcon after work is done. The routing process upstream can only start once SRT is **fully received** for the relevant PO line.

### Rules

- **1 SRT : 1 SRF. 1 SRF : n SRT.**
- Σ SRT quantity ≤ SRF quantity.
- SRT UOM must equal PO UOM.
- **No extra cost, no location, no conversion, no approval, no printout.**

### Number format

`SRTYYXXXXX` → `SRT1700003`. Yearly reset.

### Status flow

`Draft → Submitted | Void`.

### Steps to create

1. Select Company, Supplier, PO No, SRF No.
2. Insert `Returned Qty` (default = subcon-acknowledged qty).
3. SRT No auto-generated.
