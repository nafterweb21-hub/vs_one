# Delivery Order & Certificate of Conformity

---

## Delivery Order (DO)

**Purpose:** track whether WO quantities have been fully delivered to the customer. The actual delivery is done outside the system.

### Rules

- Only finished goods that have passed QC can be delivered.
- **1 DO : 1 SO.** **1 DO : n WO** (a single DO can cover multiple WOs of the same SO).
- **No return / re-delivery.** Internal-fault returns = handled offline; customer-request re-delivery = new sales order.
- **DO No is user-entered**, not system-generated.
- **No approval, no printout.**
- **`COC Required` checkbox**: if unticked, DO can be submitted with no COC. If ticked, ≥1 COC must be created and **all** related COCs must be Approved before the DO can be submitted.
- **End-to-end DO/COC flow:** Create DO → Create COC(s) → COC Check → COC Approval → DO Submission.

### Status flow

`Draft → Submitted | Void`.

## Certificate of Conformity (COC)

**Purpose:** issue a conformity certificate during delivery.

### Rules

- COC can only be **created** when the parent DO has `COC Required = ticked` **and** DO is not yet Submitted.
- **1 DO : n COC. 1 COC : 1 DO.**
- **Four types:** Spray Painting / Welding / Pressure / Final. Pressure and Final use the **same printout** ([Pressure/Final layout](printouts.md#coc-pressure--final)). Welding and Spray Painting each have their own.
- Workflows are identical across all four types.
- One COC ties to exactly **one painter or one machine**. More painters/machines → more COCs.
- **Uniqueness:** the combination of `DO No + COC Type + WO No + Routing Process + Welder + Painter + Part Number + Machine` must be unique.
- Requires **one Check + one Approval** (list of check/approval persons from Approval Level Profile). Approval can only proceed after Check is done.

### Number format

`COCYYXXXXX` → `COC1700003`. Yearly reset.

### Status flow

`Draft → Require Approval → Approved`.

### Steps to create

1. Select Customer, DO No, WO No.
2. Select COC Date and COC Type.
3. Optionally change COC Quantity / UOM.
4. Fill remaining info.
5. COC No auto-generated.
