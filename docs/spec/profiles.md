# Profile Modules

Reference / master data. Universal rules (omitted from each section below):

- Every profile has Active/Inactive status with activate-via-button; default Active.
- Fields marked "Once saved, cannot be changed" are immutable after create.
- Profiles whose dropdowns are used in operation modules: the operation module is allowed to create new entries directly when the value isn't found, **for these profiles only** — Material Type, Welding Type, Joint, Machine, Painting Method, Failure Mode. Everything else requires going to the profile first.

## 1. Company Profile

**Used by:** all printouts, PR, PO, PO-Subcon, GR, RTN, SRF, SRT.

**Rules**
- Single shared DB — companies are rows, not separate databases.
