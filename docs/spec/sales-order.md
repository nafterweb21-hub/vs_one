# Sales Order

**Purpose:** capture a confirmed sales order. (Quotation is offline; attachments can be uploaded.)
**Feeds:** Work Order, NCR, Delivery Order, COC, all reports.

## Rules

- **No access control on viewing:** all salespersons see/edit each other's SOs.
- **No printout** from the system.
- **No DELETE** — use Void.
- **No Discount column.**
- **Approval is not required.**
- **Exchange rate** comes from Currency Profile (latest).
- **Revision** allowed only while no work order has been created yet. Revision increments by 1; old revision row gets `Status = Old Version`.
- Customer must already exist in Customer Profile.
- Three-level structure: **Sales Order → Item → Batch**. Each Item batch is tied to **exactly one** Work Order; no merging batches into one WO.
- On SO confirmation, a Work Order No is **auto-generated** per batch (but the WO must still be created in the Work Order module to start operations).
- **Stop Purchase** button at batch level halts further purchasing tied to that batch.
- Purchaser can issue any Purchase Order (including PO-Subcon) once the SO is confirmed.
- **`No Routing Process` tickbox** (batch level): used when a PO-Subcon is required for this batch *with* a work order *but without* an in-house routing process — bypasses routing and goes direct to purchase.
- All purchases tied to this SO can be capped via `Stop Purchase`.

## Number format

`8XXXXX-RN` → e.g. `800003-R2`. The leading `8` rolls to `9` when 899999 is reached. `XXXXX` is a 5-digit running sequence with **no yearly reset**. `R` + `N` = revision number.

The auto-generated Work Order No per batch is `8XXXXX-A-B` where A = sequential part-no index within the SO, B = batch index within that part.

## Status flow

`Draft → Confirmed → (Revised → Old Version) | Closed | Void`
