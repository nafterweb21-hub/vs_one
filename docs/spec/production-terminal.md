# Production Terminal

**Purpose:** workstation UI where workers scan into and out of work-order routing processes. Tracks status and time spent per process; captures welding / spray painting / machining parameters on scan out.

**No user license required** to operate the terminal.

## Scan IN

1. Worker scans Work Order No (barcode from Work Order Sheet printout).
2. Right panel shows summary of WO + customer + delivery info.
3. Worker selects In-Process Description → Main Process → Routing Process → Employee Name.
4. Click `[SCAN IN]`.

### Scan IN rules

- WO must be in status **Proceed**; routing process must not be Pending-for-QC or Completed.
- If the routing process is tagged as subcon: subcon PO quantity must be **fully received** first.
- One worker may scan into **multiple** routing processes (different in-processes) at once.
- One worker may scan into multiple work orders at once.
- Machine is specified at scan-OUT (alongside parameters), not at IN.
- One worker can operate multiple machines within a single IN→OUT span.
- One machine can simultaneously run multiple routing processes across same or different WOs.
- **Duplicate routing process under one in-process**: if there are several rows of the same Main Process + Routing Process in one In-Process, the system auto-assigns the **earliest not-yet-completed** row when the worker scans in.

  Example: under in-process `Sub-Assy`, rows 2/4/5 are all `Sizing of Material / Sawing`. Row 2 is Completed, row 4 is WIP, row 5 is New. Worker scanning into `Sizing of Material / Sawing` is assigned to **row 4** (earliest non-completed).

## Scan OUT

1. Worker scans Work Order No.
2. Verify summary, select In-Process / Main Process / Routing Process / Employee.
3. Click `[SCAN OUT]`.
4. Enter **work-order-worth-of-quantity completed**.
5. System shows the appropriate parameter form (Welding / Spray Painting / Machining) if the routing process is so flagged.
6. Enter parameters.
7. Click `[OK to SCAN OUT]`.

### Scan OUT rules

- WO must be in status **Proceed**.
- Worker must have previously scanned in.
- Total completed quantity across all scans cannot exceed WO quantity.

On scan OUT, the WO → In-Process → Routing Process → Employee/Parameter rows are updated.
